beanstalk_monitor
=================

A monitor for [beanstalk](http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd) with asynchronous.

The inspiration came from [beanstalk_console](https://github.com/ptrofimov/beanstalk_console), so I called it beanstalk_monitor. :D

This project is growing, there are some features are developing.

### Features

* Asynchronous and no-block for handling jobs.
* Base on [sockjs](http://sockjs.org/)

### Installation

I recommend [virtualenvwrapprt](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/) to install this.
